<p>Hi, guys I am Sabrina Goodwin and Iâ€™m an inspiring Web Developer.  I currently attend Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and is very excited.  I have big plans for the future and improving my skills in coding will absolutely get me to the next level.  Im super nervous about whats expected to come but in a good way. </p>

<p>My first passion is hairstyling.  I have been a license cosmetologist for ten years now and I LOVE IT !!!  Now that technology is making its way to the cosmetology industry now it is my chance to bring them two together.  Being a woman in the technology and cosmetology industry the sky is the limit.  </p>
